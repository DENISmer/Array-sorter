# Array-sorter
Generating random integer arrays with sorting

This program creates an array[n] with random positive integers inside. 
Next, the loop in the method generates new lists, the size of which is taken from the first array,
and fills this list with random positive integers. If the length of the list is even,
then using the .sort() method it is sorted in ascending order, otherwise - in descending order. 
The function returns a list with sorted arrays inside.
